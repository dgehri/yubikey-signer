# Discover available certificates
.\target\release\yubikey-signer-enhanced.exe discover --detailed

# Test timestamp servers
.\target\release\yubikey-signer-enhanced.exe test-timestamps

# Verify signature with PowerShell
.\scripts\verify_signature.ps1 -FilePath "signed_app.exe"
```

## Testing Infrastructure Summary

### Feature-Gated Testing System

Our comprehensive testing setup allows selective test execution based on available resources:

#### Core Tests (`cargo test`)

- **Coverage**: 32 unit tests + 36 integration tests = 68 total tests passing
- **Scope**: Basic functionality, validation, error handling, PE parsing
- **CI Safe**: ‚úÖ Runs on all platforms without external dependencies

#### Network Tests (`cargo test --features network-tests`)

- **Coverage**: Additional 6 tests including timestamp server integration  
- **Scope**: HTTP timestamp server communication, network error handling
- **Validation**: ‚úÖ Confirmed working with <http://ts.ssl.com>
- **CI Consideration**: Requires internet access

#### Hardware Tests (`cargo test --features hardware-tests`)

- **Coverage**: Additional 6 tests for YubiKey hardware operations
- **Scope**: Real YubiKey connection, certificate retrieval, signing operations
- **Requirements**: Physical YubiKey connected + TEST_YUBIKEY_PIN environment variable
- **CI Safe**: ‚úÖ Gracefully skipped when hardware unavailable

#### Integration Tests (`cargo test --features integration-tests`)

- **Coverage**: Full feature set including network-tests + hardware-tests
- **Scope**: Complete end-to-end signing workflow with real hardware and timestamp server

### Test Execution Guide

```bash
# Basic functionality (CI-safe)
cargo test

# Add network testing (timestamp servers)
cargo test --features network-tests

# Add hardware testing (requires YubiKey)  
$env:TEST_YUBIKEY_PIN="your-actual-pin"
cargo test --features hardware-tests

# Full integration testing (hardware + network)
$env:TEST_YUBIKEY_PIN="your-actual-pin" 
cargo test --features integration-tests
```

## Issue Resolution History

### Security Audit Issues (RESOLVED)

- **Issue**: RSA crate vulnerabilities and dependency warnings
- **Solution**: Updated dependencies and resolved all cargo audit findings
